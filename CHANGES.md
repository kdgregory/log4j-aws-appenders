# Change History

## 2.4.1 (2020-07-29)

* Move handling of oversize/zero-length messages into log-writer. Fix
  incorrect oversize message test for CloudWatch.
  ([#121](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/121))
* Update Log4J2 dependency versions in examples, per DependaBot warning.

## 2.4.0 (2020-06-13)

* Allow substitutions to retrieve values from the Systems Manager
  Parameter Store.
  ([#68](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/68))
* Allow appenders to assume a role. This supports cross-account logging.
  ([#92](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/92))
* `JsonLayout` now optionally includes AWS account ID (Log4J1 and Logback).
  ([#95](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/95))
* Can now change the SNS subject after configuration, for Log4J1 and
  Logback.
  ([#96](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/96))
* Log4J2 appenders now use the layout's character set for subclasses of
  `StringLayout`.
  ([#101](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/101))
* Log4J2 appenders now rely on the framework's shutdown hook.
  ([#100](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/100))
* When creating a client via static factory method, you can now provide
  a method that receives configuration parameters `assumedRole`, `region`,
  and `endpoint` (see [client docs](docs/client.md#clientfactory)).
  ([#102](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/102))
* If the configured client creation mechanism fails, do not fallback to
  an alternative mechanism (ie, don't blindly write in current account).
  ([#105](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/105))
* Log4J2 lookups now delegate to substitutions for all values (but still
  support the keys implemented in 2.3.0 for backwards compatibility).

## 2.3.0 (2020-03-21)

* Support Log4J 2.x
* Appenders are no longer usable with JRE 1.6. The
  [documented](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/blob/master/README.md#dependencies)
  minimum JRE version has been 1.7 since the 2.0 release. However, the
  classfiles were formerly compiled for 1.6 compatibility. The Log4J2
  implementation, however, requires 1.7, so all build scripts were updated.
* CloudWatchLogWriter: set retention policy in thread that successfully
  created the log group (was executing from every thread, causing spurious
  exceptions but otherwise succeeding).

## 2.2.2 (2019-10-20)

* CloudWatch appender now provides `dedicatedWriter` configuration parameter,
  which tells the writer that it doesn't need to retain the latest sequence
  number for each writes, reducing the likelihood of throttling.
  ([#89](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/89))

## 2.2.1 (2019-05-05)

* CloudWatch appender allows setting retention period when creating log group.
  ([#87](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/87))
* Rewrote standalone examples to perform a random walk rather than just output
  random values (more useful for presentations).
* Logging configuration for examples now requires AWS appenders to be explicitly
  enabled (to avoid accidental resource creation and unexpected charges).

## 2.2.0 (2019-02-10)

* Add a shutdown hook to avoid losing queued messages when the main thread exits.
  ([#35](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/35))
* Enable synchonous operation of log-writer, to avoid losing messages in Lambda
  or other limited-runtime environments. See [docs](docs/design.md#synchronous-mode)
  for more information.
  ([#73](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/73))
* Allow configuring client region when creating client with SDK builder.
  ([#74](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/74))
* Allow "env" and "sysprop" substitutions to provide a default value.
  ([#75](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/75))
* Remove internal retries from `KinesisLogWriter`.
  ([#77](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/77))

## 2.1.1 (2019-01-06)

* Fixed service-client creation code so that it would not need SDK JARs for
  all supported destinations.
  ([#71](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/71))

## 2.1.0 (2018-12-26)

* Support for the [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/) logging framework.
* KinesisAppender now uses `{random}` to configure random partition keys, with
  empty string still supported for Log4J 1.x.
* JsonLayout and JsonAccessLayout now default to including hostname in output.
* JsonLayout for Log4J no longer includes tab characters in stack traces.
  ([#57](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/57))
* SNSAppender verifies that subject is valid (< 100 ASCII characters), will not
  start if invalid.
  ([#67](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/67))

## 2.0.2 (2018-12-08)

* Bugfix: was not correctly handling `InvalidSequenceTokenException` retries,
  potentially causing a `DataAlreadyAcceptedException` and duplicate log
  entries.
  ([#63](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/63), also
   [#59](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/59))

## 2.0.1 (2018-11-28)

* Bugfix: was not limiting wait at shutdown, leaving writer thread dangling
  after app-server redeploy.
  ([#56](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/56))
* Eliminate use of ThreadLocal in JSON conversion.
  (also [#56](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/56))
* CloudWatchLogWriter silently retries on `InvalidSequenceTokenException`,
  which indicates a non-serious race condition between writers. See
  [this](docs/cloudwatch.md#invalidsequencetokenexception-and-logstream-throttling)
  for more information.
  ([#59](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/59))
* Add a web-app example, to demonstrate configuring and shutting down Log4J
  via `ContextListener` along with adding unique request IDs to the mapped
  diagnostic context.

## 2.0.0 (2018-10-29)

* Split the library into front-end and back-end components, in preparation for
  adding additional logging frameworks. Included general cleanup and refactoring.
* Changed the Maven group ID from `com.kdgregory.log4j` to `com.kdgregory.logging`.
* JMX integration now uses the "marker bean" name as a base name for statistics
  beans (was formerly tied to Log4J's naming convention).
  ([#53](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/53))

## 1.3.0 (2018-09-09)

* Added [JMX integration](docs/jmx.md): appenders/writers now report
  runtime statistics such as error messages and number of records sent.
  ([#21](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/21))
* Add `autoCreate` property to Kinesis and SNS appenders. Report an
  error if stream/topic doesn't exist and this property isn't set. If
  if is set, create the stream/topic.
  ([#37](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/37),
   [#45](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/45))
* `CloudWatchAppender` will now re-create logstream if it's deleted after
  appender initializes.
  ([#46](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/46))
* `JSONLayout` will optionally add newlines to the end of each record.
  This is useful when processing logs that don't go to ElasticSearch.
  ([#42](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/42))


## 1.2.2 (2018-05-16)

* Bugfix: writer thread was not a daemon, would keep application from shutting down
  unless explicitly terminated.
  ([#38](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/38))


## 1.2.1 (2018-01-06)

* Enable per-record random partition keys for `KinesisAppender`. This can make better
  use of a multi-shard stream for applications with high logging output.
  ([#24](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/24))
* Added the `clientFactory` property, which instructs appenders to call a static factory
  method to create their AWS service client.
  ([#28](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/28))
* Use reflection to create AWS service clients from default factory methods. This will
  be the default behavior for most SDK versions.
  ([#30](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/30))
* Allow explicit endpoint configuration. This is intended to support clients using older
  AWS SDKs that don't want to direct output to the `us-east-1` region.
  ([#30](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/30))
* When creating a service client via constructor, attempt to set the region from the
  `AWS_REGION` environment variable. This is an alternative to specifying `endpoint`
  in your logger config, but in my opinion isn't very useful because the list of
  available regions is dependent on your SDK version. For example, SDK 1.11.0 doesn't
  know about the `us-east-2` region.
  ([#30](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/30))


## 1.2.0 (2017-12-30)

* Added [SNS](docs/sns.md) as a destination.
* `CloudWatchAppender` and `KinesisAppender` now refuse to initialize if given an invalid
  stream/group name. In earlier revisions they would try to strip out invalid characters,
  but this meant that you could send messages to the wrong place. Better to fail fast.
* If unable to initialize, set internal queue to discard all messages. This avoids
  unnecessary memory consumption for messages that will never be sent.
* Allowed discard threshold and action to be reconfigured at runtime. This was added to
  support handling initialization errors, but may be useful for some applications.


## 1.1.3 (2017-12-12)

* Bugfix: `CloudWatchAppender` now handles multi-part results from `DescribeLogGroups`
  and `DescribeLogStreams`. This was unlikely to happen in the real world, but could
  affect sites with large numbers of similarly-named groups or streams.
* Bugfix: `KinesisAppender` is now more resilient to rate limiting during initialization.
  This was primarily an issue with the integration tests, which create and delete streams
  at a high rate. In normal operations it could happen if a large number of applications
  started logging at the same time (such as a fleet of instances starting).
* `AbstractLogWriter` now tracks whether an error happened during initialization. This is
  currently used for testing, but will be exposed via JMX at some future point.


## 1.1.2 (2017-10-16)

* Added [JsonLayout](docs/jsonlayout.md).
* Added an example application that sends output to all appenders.


## 1.1.1 (2017-10-10)

* Added configurable message discard, to avoid out-of-memory errors when
  connectivity to AWS is spotty.
  ([#15](https://github.com/kdgregory/log4j-aws-appenders/issues/15))


## 1.1.0 (2017-09-29)

* Added [Kinesis](docs/kinesis.md) as a destination.
* Improved implementation of `CloudWatchAppender`, including integration tests.


## 1.0.1 (2017-09-02)

* Bugfix: CloudWatch SDK dependency not marked as provided; might cause conflict
  with a project's own dependency versions.
* Bugfix: Default configuration was incorrect: log stream name was "{startTimestamp}",
  should be "{startupTimestamp}"
* Bugix: more resilient to rate limiting of logstream/loggroup creation.


## 1.0.0 (2017-08-12)

* Initial release: [CloudWatch Logs](docs/cloudwatch.md) as a destination.
