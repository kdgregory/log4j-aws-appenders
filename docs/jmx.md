# JMX Support

The appenders will optionally register JMX "statistics beans" with one or more MBeanServers.
These beans provide information about the configuration and current operation of the 
log writers. See [below](#attributes) for the description of each attribute.

## Enabling

To enable JMX reporting you must register an instance of `StatisticsMBean` with one or more
MBeanServers. If you're using Log4J, you should register `HierarchyDynamicMBean` at the same
time.

```
ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer().createMBean(
        HierarchyDynamicMBean.class.getName(),
        new ObjectName("log4j:name=Config"));

ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer().createMBean(
        StatisticsMBean.class.getName(),
        new ObjectName("log4j:name=Statistics"));
```

The `ObjectName` that you use to register these beans can be anything. I find it easier, as here,
to use a namespace that's consistent with the framework I'm using.

> Note: this represents a change from version 1.0 of the appenders, which would also ignore the
  namespace used to register `StatisticsMBean` and instead pick a name that organized the
  statistics beans under the Log4J-managed beans.

The example program, as a stand-alone application, uses the JVM's platform MBeanServer. Depending on
the framework that your application uses, you may want to register with a framework-supplied server
(for example, Spring provides its own server and expects you to
[register your JMX beans](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#jmx)
with the rest of your beans).

If your application explicitly unregisters the `StatisticsMBean`, then the appenders will unregister
themselves from the same server(s). The appenders will also unregister themselves when closed. Normally
you'd never do this: appenders only get closed when the application shuts down or is unloaded.


## Classpath Isolation

Internally, the appenders library maintains the associations between StatisticMBeans, appender MBeans,
and MBeanServers in statically-referenced data structures. This is necessary to avoid the inevitable
race conditions between appender creation and `StatisticMBean` registration without creating explicit
links between them.

To avoid strange JMX behavior -- for example, beans registered under one web-app but not another
running in the same server -- you should load the appenders library in the same classloader as Log4J.
You should do this anyway, to avoid Log4J configuration errors.

## Attributes

Note: the authoritative documentation for each value is maintained as JavaDoc in the MXBean interfaces.

All log writers support the following attributes:

* `MessagesSent`  
  The number of messages successfully written to the destination.
* `MessagesSentLastBatch`  
  The number of messages successfully sent in the last batch. This number can be used to tune the
  batch delay for your application.
* `MessagesRequeuedLastBatch`  
  The number of messages that could not be sent in the last batch, and were requeued for a later
  batch. This should be zero. For `KinesisAppender`, a persistent non-zero value indicates that
  one or more partitions is at its limit for accepting messages. You should either increase the
  number of partitions, or change to a different (perhaps random) partition key.
* `MessagesDiscarded`  
  The number of messages that have been discarded by the writer due to queue backlog.
* `LastErrorMessage`  
  The last error message generated by the writer, if any. This normally contains an exception name and
  message, but may be a more generic error such as "initialization failure", and may not have an
  associated exception.
* `LastErrorTimestamp`  
  The time that the last writer error occurred, if any.
* `LastErrorStacktrace`  
  The stacktrace from the last writer error, if it involved an exception.

`CloudWatchLogWriter` provides the following additional attributes, defined by
[CloudWatchWriterStatisticsMXBean](../aws-shared/src/main/java/com/kdgregory/logging/aws/cloudwatch/CloudWatchWriterStatisticsMXBean.java):

* `ActualLogGroupName`  
  The actual destination log group name, after subsitutions have been applied to the configured name.
* `ActualLogStreamName`  
  The actual destination log stream name, after subsitutions have been applied to the configured name.
* `WriterRaceRetries`  
  The number of batches that retried due to `InvalidSequenceTokenException`. See
  [this](cloudwatch.md#invalidsequencetokenexception-and-logstream-throttling) for more information.
* `UnrecoveredWriterRaceRetries`  
  The number of batches that were requeued due to repeated `InvalidSequenceTokenException` responses.
  This value should be zero; if it is a significant fraction of `WriterRaceRetries` this indicates
  that you have too many appenders writing to the same stream.

`KinesisLogWriter` provides the following additional attributes, defined by
[KinesisWriterStatisticsMXBean](../aws-shared/src/main/java/com/kdgregory/logging/aws/kinesis/KinesisWriterStatisticsMXBean.java).

* `ActualStreamName`  
  The actual destination stream name, after subsitutions have been applied to the configured name.

`SNSLogWriter` provides the following additional attributes, defined by
[SNSWriterStatisticsMXBean](../aws-shared/src/main/java/com/kdgregory/logging/aws/sns/SNSWriterStatisticsMXBean.java).

* `ActualTopicName`  
  The actual destination topic name, after substitutions have been applied. This is set from configuration
  and then updated after the writer has initialized (so will be blank if you configure ARN and the writer
  fails to initialize).
* `ActualTopicArn`  
  The actual destination topic ARN, after substitutions have been applied. This is set from configuration
  and then updated after the writer has initialized (so will be blank if you configure by name and the
  writer fails to initialize).
* `ActualSubject`  
  The subject used for any messages, after subsitutions have been applied. Subjects are optional so this
  may be blank.
