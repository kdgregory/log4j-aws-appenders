/**
 *  Creates and starts a new thread for running the LogWriter.
 *  <p>
 *  Appenders expected to create a background thread (via factory) at the same time
 *  they create the logwriter (also via factory), and pass the latter to the former.
 *  In practice, this will happen in an abstract superclass, and the factory allows
 *  that superclass to know nothing of the actual writer type.
 *  <p>
 *  To handle unexpected thread death, the appender must provide an uncaught
 *  exception handler. A typical handler will log the event using the internal
 *  logger, and then shut itself down (the assumption is that recoverable exceptions
 *  will be caught).
 *  <p>
 *  <code>DefaultThreadFactory</code> provides a standard implementation of this
 *  interface. This module also provides <code>NullThreadFactory</code> and
 *  <code>InlineThreadFactory</code>, which are used for unit tests.
