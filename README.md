# log4j-aws-appenders

Appenders for Log4J 1.x that write to various AWS services.

This project started because I couldn't find an appender that would write to CloudWatch.
That's not strictly true: I found several for Log4J 2.x, and of course there's the
appender that AWS provides for Lambda. And then, after I started this project, I found
an appender for 1.x.

But, this seemed to be an easy weekend project, and I'd be able to get exactly what I
wanted if I was willing to reinvent a wheel. After some thought, I expanded the idea:
why not reinvent several wheels, and be able to write to multiple destinations? It's
been more than a dozen weekends since I started the project; I keep getting new ideas.

Here are the destinations I (plan to) support:

* [x] [CloudWatch Logs](docs/cloudwatch.md): basic logging that allows keyword search and time ranges
* [x] [Kinesis Streams](docs/kinesis.md): can be used as a source for Kinesis Firehose, and thence ElasticSearch or S3 storage
* [ ] SNS: I think it might be useful to create an "error notifier"

In addition to the appenders, I've added a [JSON layout](docs/jsonlayout.md) to make
it easier to send data to an ElasticSearch/Kibana cluster.


## Usage

To use these appenders, include the `aws-appenders` JAR in your project, and configure
the desired appender in your Log4J properties. Each appender's documentation gives an
example configuration, and I have created an [example project](example) that writes to
all of the supported destinations (along with a CloudFormation template to set up Kinesis
Firehose and ElasticSearch).

### Dependency Versions

To avoid dependency hell, all dependencies are marked as "provided": you will need
to ensure that your project includes necessary dependencies. The minimum supported
depedencies are as follows:

* JDK: 1.6  
  The appender code does not rely on standard libary classes/methods introduced
  after 1.6. I have compiled and run the example on an OpenJDK 1.6 installation.
  Be aware, however, that the AWS SDK might change at any time.
* Log4J: 1.2.16  
  This is the first version that implements `LoggingEvent.getTimeStamp()`, which
  is needed to order messages when sending to AWS. It's been around since 2010,
  so if you haven't upgraded already you should.
* AWS SDK: 1.11.0  
  Amazon changed the return type of several functions between 1.10.x and 1.11.x.
  If your project is still using 1.10.x, you can recompile the appenders locally
  with that version; I have built and tested with 1.10.1. Note, however, that the
  integration tests use client-builder classes that weren't introduced until midway
  in the 1.11.x release sequence.

I have made an intentional effort to limit dependencies to the bare minimum. This
has in some cases meant that I write internal implementations for functions that
are found in common libraries (including my own).

Note that tests may introduce their own dependencies. These will all be found on
Maven Central, and will be marked as `test` scope in the POM.


## Building

There are two projects in this repository:

* `appender` is the actual appender code.
* `tests` is a set of integration tests. These are in a separate module so that they can be run as
  desired, rather than as part of every build.

Classes in the `com.kdgregory.log4j.aws` package are expected to remain backwards compatible. Any
other classes, particularly those in the `com.kdgregory.log4j.aws.internal` package, may change
arbitrarily and should not be relied-upon by user code. This caveat also applies to all test
classes and packages.


### Versions

I follow the standard `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` versioning scheme:

* `MAJOR` will track the Log4J major version number (yes, eventually I'll release a version for Log4J 2.x).
* `MINOR` will be incremented for each destination (CloudWatch, Kinesis, &c).
* `PATCH` will be incremented to reflect bugfixes or additional features; significant bugfixes will be
  backported so that you can continue using the same minor release.
  
Not all versions will be released to Maven Central. I may choose to make release (non-snapshot) versions for
development testing, or as interim steps of a bigger piece of functionality. However, all release versions
are tagged in source control, whether or not available on Maven Central.

The source tree also contains commits with major version of 0. These are "pre-release" versions, and may change
in arbitrary ways. Please do not use them.


### Source Control

The `master` branch is intended for "potentially releasable" versions. Commits on master
are functional, but may not be "complete" (for some definition of that word). They may be
"snapshot" or release builds. Master will never be rebased; once a commit is made there
it's part of history for better or worse.

Development takes place on a `dev-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` branch; these branches are deleted
once their content has been merged into `master`. *BEWARE*: these branches may be rebased
as I see fit.

Each "release" version is tagged with `release-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, whether or not it was
uploaded to Maven Central.

Merges into `master` are handled via pull requests, with a squash merge. If you want to see
the individual commits that went into a branch, you can look at the closed PR.


## FAQ

Isn't Log4J 1.x at end of life?

> Yep. Have you updated all of your applications yet? If you have, congratulations.
  I haven't, nor have a lot of people that I know. Replacing a stable logging
  framework is pretty low on the priority list.

If you found other appenders, why are you writing this?

> Reinventing wheels can be a great spur to creativity. It also gives me a deeper
  understanding of the services involved, which is a Good Thing. And of course I've
  added features that I didn't find elsewhere.

What happens when the appender drops messages?

> All misbehaviors get logged using the Log4J internal logger. To see messages from
  this logger, set the system property `log4j.configDebug` to `true` (note that the
  internal logger always writes messages to StdErr).

What are all these messages from `com.amazonaws` and `org.apache.http`?

> You attached the `CloudWatchAppender` to your root logger. There are two solutions;
  the first is to attach the appender only to your program's classes (here I turn off
  additivity, so the messages _won't_ go to the root logger; you might prefer sending
  messages to both destinations).

    log4j.logger.com.myprogram=DEBUG, cloudwatch
    log4j.additivity.com.myprogram=false

> Or alternatively, shut off logging for those packages that you don't care about.

    log4j.logger.org.apache.http=ERROR
    log4j.logger.com.amazonaws=ERROR

> My preference is to attach the CloudWatch appender to my application classes, and use
  the built-in `ConsoleAppender` as the root logger. This ensures that you have some
  way to track "meta" issues with the logging configuration.

> Note that seeing unwanted messages is a problem with whatever appender you might use.
  It's more apparent here because the logger invokes code that itself writes log messages.
