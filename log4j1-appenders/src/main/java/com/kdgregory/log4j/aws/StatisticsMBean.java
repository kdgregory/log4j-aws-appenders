/**
 *  This class provides a bridge between the writer statistics exposed by an
 *  appender and an MBeanServer. When an instance of this class has been
 *  registered, it will in turn register all statistics beans loaded by the
 *  same classloader hierarchy.
 *  <p>
 *  <h1>Example</strong>
 *  <pre>
 *      ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer().createMBean(
 *              HierarchyDynamicMBean.class.getName(),
 *              new ObjectName("log4j:name=Config"));
 *
 *      ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer().createMBean(
 *              StatisticsMBean.class.getName(),
 *              new ObjectName("log4j:name=Statistics"));
 *  </pre>
 *  Note that the object names for both beans can be whatever you want. The
 *  names that I show here are consistent with the hardcoded names produced
 *  by both the Log4J appender/layout beans and the writer statistics beans
 *  from this package, so if you use them you'll see everything Log4J in one
 *  place.
 *  <p>
 *  <strong>Support for multiple Log4J hierarchies</strong>
 *  <p>
 *  For a stand-alone application, you would typically register both the Log4J
 *  <code>HierarchyDynamicMBean</code> and this bean with the platform MBean
 *  server. For a multi-container deployment such as an app-server, however,
 *  you may have a container-specific MBean server. However, there's no simple
 *  way to identify which of possibly many MBean servers may be the one we use
 *  to register, or if indeed we should register.
 *  <p>
 *  The solution I've chosen is to maintain two static collections: one holds
 *  registrations for instances of this class, the other holds references to
 *  each of the configured appenders. When one or the other of these collections
 *  changes then the appropriate JMX registrations/deregistrations are performed.
 *  <p>
 *  If you never register an instance of this class, then JMX is effectively
 *  disabled.
