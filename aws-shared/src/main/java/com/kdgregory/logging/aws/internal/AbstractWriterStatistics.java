/**
 *  Base class for writer statistics, providing fields that are used by all
 *  writer implementations. Concrete appender implementations hold/expose a
 *  subclass.
 *  <p>
 *  Statistics are limited to primitives and strings so that they can be read
 *  by JMX. Statistics will be read and written by different threads, so must
 *  be marked as volatile. A given statistic will only be written by appender
 *  or writer, not both, so there's no need for synchronization unless there's
 *  the possibility of multiple writers. In that case, implement an override
 *  in the subclass and synchronize there.
 *  <p>
 *  Note: the MXBean interface implemented by subclasses must explicitly expose
 *  any desired getters (we can't use a superinterface because JMX introspection
 *  only looks at declared methods).
