<p> This package exists to allow retrieval of information from AWS for optional
    functionality, such as assuming a role. This functionality is typically
    invoked from common classes, so if it was implemented using actual client
    classes it would establish a hard dependency on the relevant library. This
    goes against my "minimal required dependencies" goal, so I use reflection
    to instantiate and invoke the functionality.
